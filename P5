# Making maps with R {#adv-map}

## Prerequisites {-}

- This chapter requires the following packages that we have already been using:

```{r, message=FALSE} 
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
library(spData)
library(spDataLarge)
```

- In addition it uses the following visualization packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)    # for static and interactive maps
library(leaflet) # for interactive maps
library(mapview) # for interactive maps
library(shiny)   # for web applications
```

## Introduction

A satisfying and important aspect of geographic research is communicating the results.
Map making --- the art of cartography --- is an ancient skill that involves communication, intuition, and an element of creativity.
Static mapping is straightforward with `plot()`, as we saw in section \@ref(basic-map).
It is possible to create advanced maps using base R methods [@murrell_r_2016], but this chapter focuses on dedicated map-making packages.
When learning a new skill, it makes sense to gain depth-of-knowledge in one area branching out.
Map making is no exception, hence this chapter's coverage of one package (**tmap**) in depth rather than many superficially.
In addition to being fun and creative, cartography also has important practical applications.
A carefully crafted map be vital for effectively communicating the results of your work [@brewer_designing_2015]:

> Amateur-looking maps can undermine your audienceâs ability to understand important information and weaken the presentation of a professional data investigation.

<!-- Todo: consider adding footnote saying it's good to focus on visualization early as in R4DS but that we cover it later because there's a risk of getting distracted by pretty pictures to the detriment of good analysis. -->

Maps have been used for several thousand years for a wide variety of purposes.
Historic examples include maps of buildings and land ownership in the Old Babylonian dynasty more than 3000 years ago and Ptolemy's world map in his masterpiece *Geography* nearly 2000 years ago [@talbert_ancient_2014].

Map making has historically been an activity undertaken only by, or on behalf of, the elite.
This has changed with the emergence of open source mapping software such as the R package **tmap** and the 'print composer' in QGIS which enable anyone to make high quality maps, enabling 'citizen science'.
Maps are also often the best way to present the findings of geocomputational research in a way that is accessible.
Map making is therefore a critical part of geocomputation and its emphasis not only on describing, but also *changing* the world.
